# SVG Introduction

## Prerequisites

Understanding the concepts of working with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and the DOM. Also realizing that SVG is a XML language similar to HTML:

- XML is a framework for specifying markup languages
- HTML is a predefined markup language
- SVG is a predefined markup language

Understanding that SVG is its own language and HTML _supports_ SVG but SVG is not part of the HTML specifications. HTML5 also offers a DOM interface to manipulate SVG elements in the DOM.

## Essentials

- Repository from Github (Classroom) **svg-introduction**

## Starting point

Clean HTML and JavaScript file

## Preparation

Trainer:

- Give everyone access tot the repository via GitHub classroom
- Explain what SVG is and why we want to use it

Participant:

- Download repository
- Read README.MD
- Study the text from the provided links below if necessary

## Learning objective

Learning what SVG is and getting a feeling with its basics.

## Description

SVG is an XML language, similar to HTML, which can be used to draw two dimensional based vector graphics.

It&#39;s a text-based, open Web standard for describing images that can be rendered cleanly at any size without loss of quality and are designed specifically to work well with other web standards including CSS, DOM, JavaScript. SVG is, essentially, to graphics what HTML is to text.

It can be used to create an image either by specifying all the lines and shapes necessary, by modifying already existing raster images, or by a combination of both. The image and its components can also be transformed, composited together, or filtered to change their appearance completely.

A simple SVG document consists of nothing more than the \&lt;svg\&gt; root element and several basic shapes that build a graphic together. In addition there is the \&lt;g\&gt; element, which is used to group several basic shapes together.

Currently, we are at version 1.1 of SVG since 2003 (yes that is old) and version 2.0 is still under development and in a so called &#39;W3C Candidate Recommendation&#39; stage since 2018, although it is still to be seen if version 2.0 will ever be fully released and implemented by all the major browser.

For our introduction to SVG, we will look at the basic concepts of embedding a \&lt;svg\&gt; element in our document model, adding some elements to it and manipulating those elements with JavaScript via the DOM interface.

## Result

After the assignment you will have used and created a graphic(s) and touched on the most basic concepts of SVG. You will understand how SVG is used to draw predefined basic shapes.

## Libraries

None, HTML natively supports SVG
